# Conditional Rendering

The `GLTFViewer` component supports conditional rendering in that when the component gets unmounted, the viewer object is destroyed/cleaned up. See [the issue](https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-sdk/issues/79#issuecomment-501767463) this solves.

A simple conditional rendering demo can be found in the `demo/component-demos/ConditionalRender.js` file.
