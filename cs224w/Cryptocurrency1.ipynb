    "- This burst has been mainly fueled by the opportunity generated by the ICO mechanism used by companies as a new channel to fund innovation. \n",

    "- Furthermore, this burst follows the surge of new business models based on blockchain and associated digital tokens and crypto-money.\n",

    "- In this paper we investigate how cryptocurrency prices collectively behave and how the price behaviour is related with the sentiment behaviour expressed through Twitter and StockTwits messages that refer explicitly to the related currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this work we uncover signals revealing that these marginal currencies play a statistically significant role in the collective dynamics of prices and their interplay with social sentiment. Therefore they should not be excluded a-priori from the investigation and their role with respect the major currencies must be studied in detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "-  This opens new challenges for what concerns investment strategies and risk management which must handle very large number of variables and cannot be limited to the study of a few influential factors"
