    "- We propose a modified SRU architecture called economy SRU or eSRU in short. The first of the two proposed modifications is aimed at substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters in the standard SRU model without sacrificing its expressiveness. The second modification entails regularizing the SRU’s internal weight parameters to enhance the interpretability of its learned predictive features. Compared to the standard SRU, the proposed eSRU model is considerably less likely to overfit the time series measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We conduct extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate that eSRU is a compelling model for inferring pairwise Granger causality. The proposed model is found to outperform the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), LSTM and attention-gated convolutional neural network (AG-CNN) based models considered in the earlier works.\n",
